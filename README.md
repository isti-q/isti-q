ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm a QA professional with over 3 years of experience making sure software works the way it should and making it better when it doesn't. I've worn many hats in this role, from doing hands-on manual testing to building automation scripts, and even leading a QA team.

Most of my experience has been in the streaming and entertainment industry, where quality and smooth user experience really matter. I'm known for my attention to detail - I love catching those edge cases that others might miss. I also make it a point to really understand the business side of things, because testing isnâ€™t just about finding bugs, itâ€™s about making sure the product supports real users and real goals.

I work with tools like ClickUp and TestRail to stay organized, and Iâ€™m comfortable writing automation using JavaScript and Python. Iâ€™ve used frameworks like WebdriverIO, Selenium, and Appium to automate tests for both web and mobile apps.

Right now, Iâ€™m focusing on growing into a full SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) role. Iâ€™m working on leveling up my coding skills and building smarter, scalable test automation that fits into modern dev workflows.

Always happy to connect, share ideas, or nerd out about testing tools and tech. ðŸ˜Š
